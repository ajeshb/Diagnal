Known Issues: 
   1) Search is implemented with in the loaded data only. No api call is added. 
   2) Data loading on scroll may have issues in very low network speed.
      Network speed factor is not added in deciding the time of next api call. We can dynamically change multiple factor in this algorithm according to network speed.
   3) No loading indicator added on search action.
